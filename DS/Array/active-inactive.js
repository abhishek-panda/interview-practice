/**
 * 
Given a binary array of size n where n > 3. A true (or 1) value in the array means active and false (or 0) means inactive. Given a number k, the task is to find count of active and inactive cells after k days. After every day, status of iâ€™th cell becomes active if left and right cells are not same and inactive if left and right cell are same (both 0 or both 1).
Since there are no cells before leftmost and after rightmost cells, the value cells before leftmost and after rightmost cells is always considered as 0 (or inactive).
Input : cells[] = {1, 0, 1, 1}, k = 2 Output : Active cells = 3, Inactive cells = 1 After 1 day, cells[] = {0, 0, 1, 1} After 2 days, cells[] = {0, 1, 1, 1}
